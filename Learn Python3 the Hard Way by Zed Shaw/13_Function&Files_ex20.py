fp.seek(offset, from_what)
where fp is the file pointer you're working with; offset means how many positions you will move; from_what defines your point of reference:

0: means your reference point is the beginning of the file
1: means your reference point is the current file position
2: means your reference point is the end of the file
if omitted, from_what defaults to 0.
